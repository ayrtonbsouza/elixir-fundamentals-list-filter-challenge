# ListFilter

This is a application developed as a challenge for Elixir Ignite Bootcamp, proposed by RocketSeat.

## About the challenge

In this challenge, I had to create a new project with a function that, given a list of strings that represent numbers or not (example `[" 1 "," 3 "," 6 "," 43 "," banana "," 6 "," abc "]`), filter all numeric elements in the list and return how many odd numbers are in that list.

We can follow the expected result by observing the following example of executing the function:

``` bash
iex> ListFilter.call (["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6", "abc"])
...> 3
```

If you want to test this implementation from the terminal, run `iex -S mix` inside the project's root directory ðŸš€
